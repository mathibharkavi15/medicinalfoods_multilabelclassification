Ready to use! 100% Pure, Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils Diluted in Fractionated Coconut Oil. 10 ml (1/3 oz).","I bought this Tension Relief because it was recommended to me as a help for my headaches. I get terrible tension headaches and nothing else seems to help them. I bought this, used coconut oil for a carrier oil, and I massage it into my neck when I start to get a headache. It always helps. I have tried just massaging my neck without this stuff and it doesn't do a thing. I like that with this I don't have to rely on medication all the time. I would recommend this and have done so several times. I would feel confident buying anything from Plant Therapy.

287920,Astaxanthin 12mg with Organic Coconut Oil for Better Absorption - 60 Softgels (2 Month Supply),"I've been attempting to reduce chronic inflammation and other immune responses as the result of a bad infection due in part due to a faulty root canal (don't ever get one if you care about long term health btw). I've done a lot of research on this compound, decided to try it, and am very pleased. I should have tried it a lot sooner. It really does appear to be doing the job quite effectively. I take 18 mg/day to get the maximum effect. I can't say I've noticed such an effect from other supplements edit: dropping one star due to a formulation containing carrageenan. The whole point of taking this supplement was for the anti-inflammatory effects and having this ingredient really undermines that..
